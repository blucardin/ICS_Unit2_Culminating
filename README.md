## Snake

This is my cluminating assesment for unit 2 of year 2 of my introduction to computer science course. It is a super simple snake game written in java. It runs in the console, and uses wasd to control the snake.

The instructor did not require me to create a repository, however it has helped me with the development.

The assingment was, "Do something with File I/O, and arrays/arrayLists." I decided to make a snake game, and I used arrayLists to store the snake's body, the target, and the board (as well as other miscellaneous tasks). I used File I/O to store the users' settings: Color Preferences, Coins, Highschool, etc.
